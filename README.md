# launchpad-contracts

This repo contains contracts used for a fair token launch mechanism

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`

2. In order to compile the contracts, run `npx hardhat compile`. This outputs contracts in the artifacts directory

3. To add tests, you can add tests to `./test`. Refer to `Bonding.test.ts` as an example.

4. To run your tests, run `npx hardhat test` to run all tests, or run `npx hardhat test <path_to_test>` to run a specific test.

## Contracts and Architecture
